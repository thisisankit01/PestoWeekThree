//static
let a = 10;
function foo{
  // we will give a functionality to the function here \.
  // and we can calculate at compile time only whats will the result shown in the runtime.
};

//dynamic
let b = Math.random(); //The Math.random() function returns a number that's greater than or equal to 0 and less than 1 until and unless its not given any value.
//cannot calculate the result in compile time.

//static typing vs dynamic typing

// static typing
//  for eg in java: its statically typed
int a = 13;
a = 'Ankit';
// we cannot change values in static typing because the value is inizialised with single data type.

//dynamic typing: javascript
const c = 17;
c = 'Ankit';
//we can change it to anyvalue we want , so its dynamically typed.
